# Motive
NVP is aiming to:
- help collaborators share information more accurately using a mutually agreed-upon structure, and they can choose the content and amount to share with finer granularity, which can also help promote fairness.
- benefits information collectors: A clearly defined target structure can prevent feature creep, ensuring that collectors do not excessively gather information deemed useless.

## Suggested Style for Schemas
1. Contain generic fields:  
   - id -> unique identifier of the instance such as its unique name or a certain index  
   - desc -> description of the instance itself  
   - tags -> an array containing all tags to the instance
2. Avoid schema-specific nomenclature
